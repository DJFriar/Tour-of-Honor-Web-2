            <dl class="uk-description-list">
                <dt>Who determines what states and memorials to visit?</dt>
                <dd>The State Sponsors select the sites. Everyone is welcome to make suggestions.</dd>
                <dt>Will it always be individual states?</dt>
                <dd>Not always, some smaller states are combined into regions with four sites per state. Regions include New England, Mid-Atlantic, and the Dakotas.</dd>
                <dt>What happens if I don't visit all the sites?</dt>
                <dd>Nothing other than hopefully having the experience of visiting at least one.</dd>
                <dt>What kind of memorials and monuments are there?</dt>
                <dd>U.S. memorials that honor the brave people who protect -- or have protected -- our life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Some are local, some are national, all are rewarding and interesting.</dd>
                <dt>Why should we pay for a registration when the destinations are on the website?</dt>
                <dd>For one thing, it includes a $25 donation to the riders choice of charities. Then there's the quality T-shirt, flag, other SWAG, finishers certificate, trophies and mailing costs. Hopefully you'll take advantage of the sense of community here and in the popular Tour of Honor group on Facebook.</dd>
                <dt>If I change my mind, can I get a refund?</dt>
                <dd>Yes, you can get a refund up until the time the T-shirt and rally flag are mailed. We will deduct the $25 donation to your choice of charity, and a $10 aggravation fee. Refunds won't be given after the T-shirt and rally flag are mailed.</dd>
                <dt>Love the theme, how can I help?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>If you're interested, there are a number of ways you can help. Suggest an advertiser, or be an advertiser on the website. Suggest memorials. Invite your friends. Submit a post on motorcycle forums. Write a letter to the editor of a motorcycle magazine.</p>
                    <p>And if you're familiar with several memorial sites in your state and can provide photos and writeups, please email us, saying you're interested in sponsoring your state or region.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What are the rules to qualify for Finishers certificates?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Rules will be mailed with the T-shirt and rally flag, but the most complete set of Rules are here ON THIS PAGE.</p>
                    <p>Basically, photos must be submitted that include three things: the memorial from an angle similar to that on the website, your rally flag, and your motorcycle. It won't always be possible to ride your motorcycle up to the memorial, and in that instance, two photos must be submitted: one with the memorial and your rally flag, and one nearby with your motorcycle and your rally flag. It should be obvious that your motorcycle was at least *near* the memorial. Your rally flag should be in all photos submitted.</p>
                    <p>Decisions about evidence of visiting sites will be at the discretion of the scorekeepers and if it's not clear from the photographs, you may be asked to return to take new photos. This will be critical when competing for trophies.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>How do we submit the photos?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Digital photos or prints are accepted. Digital submissions can be on CD, DVD, SD cards or thumb drives, in JPEG or TIFF formats. Mail photos to the address given in the Rules above. Emailed photos or cameraphone photos should be sent to photos@tourofhonor.com. Naming conventions are included in the Rules above.</p>
                    <p>For those who want to share their photos, you can always post them on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/130290830851907" target="_blank">Tour of Honor Group Facebook page</a>.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>When will the Finishers certificates be sent out?</dt>
                <dd>Finishers certificates and pins will be mailed after the season ends.</dd>
                <dt>What if we can't access a memorial site?</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>There might be restricted access to some sites, mostly because of hours of operation, and it is up to riders to determine that ahead of time. <strong>Photos for trophy submissions must be taken during hours of operation.</strong></p>
                    <p>If a site is closed due to maintenance, road closures, security precautions or other reasons making it impossible to visit, take a photo of a nearby sign for the site, along with your bike and rally flag.</p>
                </dd>
                <dt>What happens if I lose my rally flag?</dt>
                <dd>You will be allowed credit for memorials with a facsimile of your flag (your rider number on a piece of paper will do) for up to one week after we hear of the loss. Additional memorials will require a replacement flag. Order a replacement from the <a href="https://shop.tourofhonor.com" target="_blank">online store</a> and one will be mailed to you.</dd>
                <dt>What happens if I come across someone else's rally flag left behind?</dt>
                <dd>If this happens, leave it there because someone may be returning for it shortly. If you can, email us the location and the rider number and we'll put the word out.</dd>
                <dt>Do you target a particular type of rider or motorcycle brand?</dt>
                <dd>Absolutely not. We want to include anyone who likes to ride AND respects what others have done for their community and country.</dd>
                <dt>Can I use different motorcycles?</dt>
                <dd>Yes. No problem...no penalty...no need to notify us. But if you want to change your motorcycle listed on the Rider List, email us at admin@tourofhonor.com</dd>
                <dt>Can I order shirts after registration?</dt>
                <dd>Yes. Visit the <a href="https://shop.tourofhonor.com" target="_blank">online store</a> to order shirts and other items. Additional current year shirts won't be subject to shipping charges if mailed out with your registration packet.</dd>
